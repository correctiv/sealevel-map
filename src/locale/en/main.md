Even a rise in sea levels by one centimeter directly impacts coastal populations. Storms and floods submerge their fields and housing. In some regions, people are already being forced out of their homes. These trends will continue. Places where the water has already significantly increased face the threat of even higher levels in the future.

Looking for data on global sea levels, we came across the British Permanent Service of Mean Sea Level (PSMSL). Its scientists have been gathering data on sea levels from around the world since the mid 19th century. Their data therefor predates modern data gathered with satellite imagery. The data is clear: climate change has been pushing sea levels higher for decades now. In some regions, climate change is lifting the land mass. Both trends are changing the lives of those living there. Since the middle of the 19th century, they have recorded sea level data in ports and coastal towns from Argentina to Zanzibar. Therefore, we can see a much longer timeframe than is possible with more recent monitoring methods like satellite. The data is unquestionable: Climate Change will cause sea levels to rise for decades. And a rise in land mass in some regions of the country. Both of these developments are life changing.
