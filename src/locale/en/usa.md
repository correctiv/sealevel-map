### The US East Coast: Big bucks for more protection

[North America](https://correctiv.org/recherchen/klima/artikel/2017/07/28/steigende-meere-uebersicht-nordamerika/) is also faced with rising sea levels. Alaska's perma-frost soil is thawing and is rendering villages uninhabitable. Every year, sea levels are rising on the East Coast. Miami alone has earmarked 100 million US dollar to move roads higher up, set up pumps and protect sewage systems from sea water. If the damage from the record breaking hurricanes of Harvey and Irma are of any indication, this is just the beginning of what Miami will need to spend to fight the effects of climate change.
