### South America is home to some of the world's largest wetlands. One of them is the Parana delta that flows into the Rio de la Plata, between Argentine and Uruguay. There is little hard data available as the delta and its waterways keep changing. What is clear is that the poor inhabitants of the area are increasingly faced with the threat of flooding. In the wetlands, luxury apartments and golf courses are now being constructed. But due to climate change, rich and poor alike will have to relocate. The delta risks being submerged with rising tides
