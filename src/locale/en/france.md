### Europe's beaches are sinking

The city of Palavas-les-Flots in the South of France once hoped to become the "Florida of France". Now experts are forecasting that it's beaches along with their bars, restaurants and boat rentals will submerge. The region's soil will be flushed out and the fresh water close to the coast will become salty. Same for the North Sea: the recent storm "Herwart" destroyed about 80 percent of the beaches on the island of Wangerooge. The southern most tip of Sylt had to be abandoned, it is close to breaking off.
