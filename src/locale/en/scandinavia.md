### The land rises in Scandinavia

In [Scandinavia](https://correctiv.org/recherchen/klima/artikel/2017/07/28/steigende-meere-finnland-schweden/), the land mass is rising faster than sea levels. Its glaciers are melting, reducing their weight and pressure on the land. Some ports and lakes are already falling dry. In [Vasaa](https://searise.correctiv.org/en/explore/stations/57), Finland, the land mass has risen by almost ten centimeters. In [Bodo](https://searise.correctiv.org/en/explore/stations/562), in Northern Norway, the land mass has risen by about 25 centimeters.
