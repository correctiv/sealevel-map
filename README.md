# Rising seas

This web application is a tool for exploring [tide gauge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tide_gauge) data, based on the [PSMSL](http://www.psmsl.org/) data set. It visualizes the sea level change over the past decades. This data explorer was originally built as part of CORRECTIVâ€™s [reporting on climate change](https://correctiv.org/recherchen/klima/artikel/2017/07/28/steigende-meere-ueberblick-weltweit/).

Running in production:

This project uses the HTML history API for client-side routing. In order to serve it in production, the web server has to be configured to serve this app for all routes. Routes are then evaluated in the browser using JavaScript. 

Simply put, the webserver has to serve any files that exist, but if they don't exist, it needs to serve /index.html rather than a `404: not found`. This is sometimes called "HTML 5 mode". Learn more about it here: [React Router in the Real](https://gkedge.gitbooks.io/react-router-in-the-real/content/index.html) (this is about React Router rather than [riot/route](https://github.com/riot/route), which is used here, but the general concept is the same)
